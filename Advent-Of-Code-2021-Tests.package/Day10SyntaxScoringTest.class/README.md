Tried to implement creating a parser. using PetitParser2. could make it detect corrupt / invalid lines. But could not figure out how to extract the position where it goes wrong ... neither could i create a difference between corrupted and incomplete lines.

So did a new implementation from scratch ...  Day10SyntaxScoring2Test
